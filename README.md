# Description 
For Challenge 20, I have created a react portfolio. This portfolio includes all of my work. I have an about page that lets you get to know me more. I have a projects page that showcases my work, I have resume page where you can download my resume and see a list of my skillset and I also have a contacts page where you can get in touch with me! Links to my Github and Linkedin are also included.
